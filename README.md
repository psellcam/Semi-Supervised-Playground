# Semi-Supervised-Playground
Ever wanted to try Semi-Supervised Learning? This repo aims to be a hands on practical on applying SSL to the "Two Moons" synthetic dataset.


The overall aim of the repo is to constract supervised learning with semi-supervised learning.  The core files are

           ----- main.py : Contains a full supervised, sparse supervised, fixmatch style ssl and graph style ssl approaches
           ----- helpers.py : Helper functiosn for the main files
           
           
The code for the repo is now done. I am now looking to make it into a full Jupyter notebook style peace with tips and tricks for pytorch as well as descriptions of semi-supervised papers.
