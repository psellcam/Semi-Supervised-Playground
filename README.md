# Semi-Supervised-Playground
Ever wanted to try Semi-Supervised Learning? This repo aims to be a hands on practical on applying SSL to the "Two Moons" synthetic dataset.


The overall aim of the repo is to constract supervised learning with semi-supervised learning.  The core files are
           ----- main.py : A fully supervised approach to the "Two Moons" dataset.
           ----- main_ssl.py : A semi-supervised approach to the "Two Moons" dataset when 10% of the data is used. Uses the commmon pseudo-label method.
           ----- main_ssl_graph.py : A semi-supervised approach to the "Two Moons" dataset when 10% of the data is used. Uses a graphical approach to pseudo-label estimation.
           
           
There is a lot to do with the repo and I aim in time to make some very nice visuals to show the underlying processes at work.  :)
